How Machine Learning Works\\nAt its core, ML is about finding patterns. Instead of writing complex \"if-then\" rules, you feed a computer a large amount of data, and it builds a Model to make predictions or decisions.\\n\\nData Collection: Gathering historical information (e.g., past house prices).\\n\\nTraining: Feeding that data into an algorithm.\\n\\nThe Model: The \"brain\" created after training.\\n\\nPrediction: Giving the model new data (e.g., a house\\'s square footage) to get an output (the estimated price).\\n\\n2. The Three Main Types of ML\\nMachine Learning is generally categorized based on how the algorithm learns:\\n\\nSupervised Learning: The model is trained on \"labeled\" data (data that already has the answer).\\n\\nExample: Showing a model 1,000 photos of cats labeled \"Cat\" so it can identify cats in new photos.\\n\\nUnsupervised Learning: The model looks for hidden patterns in data that has no labels.\\n\\nExample: Grouping customers into different \"segments\" based on their shopping habits.\\n\\nReinforcement Learning: The model learns by trial and error through rewards and penalties.\\n\\nExample: A computer program learning to play Chess or drive a self-driving car.\\n4. A Simple Example\\nImagine you want to predict if an email is \"Spam\" or \"Not Spam.\"\\n\\nTraditional Programming: You would write rules like: “If it contains the word \\'Winner\\', mark as spam.” This is hard to maintain because spammers change their words.\\n\\nMachine Learning: You show the computer 10,000 emails. It notices that \"Winner\" is often spam, but also notices patterns in the sender\\'s address and the time of day that you might have missed.\\n\\n5. How to Start Learning ML\\nLearn Python Basics: You need to understand loops, lists, and functions first.\\n\\nLearn Data Analysis: Master Pandas and NumPy. You spend 80% of ML work just cleaning and organizing data.\\n\\nStart with Linear Regression: It’s the simplest ML algorithm (predicting a number).\\n\\nUse Kaggle: Kaggle.com is a website where you can find free datasets and see how other people build their models.'),\n",

Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\narXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019'),\n",

Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).

[CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al.

A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding asE, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token\\nasTi∈ RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthei-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP). 5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.'),\n",

The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text- ∅ pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model. 7 We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo ﬁne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the ﬁnal hid-\\nden vector C ∈ RH corresponding to the ﬁrst\\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\\nﬁne-tuning are classiﬁcation layer weights W ∈\\nRK×H, whereK is the number of labels. We com-\\npute a standard classiﬁcation loss with C andW ,\\ni.e., log(softmax(CW T )).\\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\\nF1 score of 91.0%.\\n8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq.'),\n",

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained.

(2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\\ninclude the maximal document context provided\\nby the data.

In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures.

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\\nery input token. Additionally, because random\\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\\nthe model’s language understanding capability. In\\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce-\\ndure.\\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\\npre-training steps may be required for the model'),\n",

The ﬁrst sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the B embed-\\nding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-\\nbined length is≤ 512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\\neration given to partial word pieces.\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9,\\nβ2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the ﬁrst 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERT BASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod conﬁguration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\\nFor ﬁne-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\\ning epochs.

The dominant approach is to pre-train on\\na large text corpus and then ﬁne-tune on a smaller task-speciﬁc dataset (Devlin et al., 2019). Thanks\\nto Transformers’ computational efﬁciency and scalability, it has become possible to train models of\\nunprecedented size, with over 100B parameters (Brown et al., 2020; Lepikhin et al., 2020). With the\\nmodels and datasets growing, there is still no sign of saturating performance.\\nIn computer vision, however, convolutional architectures remain dominant (LeCun et al., 1989;\\nKrizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2016). Inspired by NLP successes, multiple works try combining\\nCNN-like architectures with self-attention (Wang et al., 2018; Carion et al., 2020), some replacing\\nthe convolutions entirely (Ramachandran et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a). The latter models, while\\ntheoretically efﬁcient, have not yet been scaled effectively on modern hardware accelerators due to\\nthe use of specialized attention patterns. Therefore, in large-scale image recognition, classic ResNet-\\nlike architectures are still state of the art (Mahajan et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2020; Kolesnikov et al.,\\n2020).\\nInspired by the Transformer scaling successes in NLP, we experiment with applying a standard\\nTransformer directly to images, with the fewest possible modiﬁcations. To do so, we split an image\\ninto patches and provide the sequence of linear embeddings of these patches as an input to a Trans-\\nformer. Image patches are treated the same way as tokens (words) in an NLP application. We train\\nthe model on image classiﬁcation in supervised fashion.\\nWhen trained on mid-sized datasets such as ImageNet without strong regularization, these mod-\\nels yield modest accuracies of a few percentage points below ResNets of comparable size. This\\nseemingly discouraging outcome may be expected: Transformers lack some of the inductive biases\\n1Fine-tuning code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/vision_transformer\\n1\\narXiv:2010.11929v2  [cs.CV]  3 Jun 2021'),\n",

We\\nﬁnd that large scale training trumps inductive bias. Our Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent\\nresults when pre-trained at sufﬁcient scale and transferred to tasks with fewer datapoints. When\\npre-trained on the public ImageNet-21k dataset or the in-house JFT-300M dataset, ViT approaches\\nor beats state of the art on multiple image recognition benchmarks. In particular, the best model\\nreaches the accuracy of 88.55% on ImageNet, 90.72% on ImageNet-ReaL, 94.55% on CIFAR-100,\\nand 77.63% on the VTAB suite of 19 tasks.\\n2 R ELATED WORK\\nTransformers were proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) for machine translation, and have since be-\\ncome the state of the art method in many NLP tasks. Large Transformer-based models are often\\npre-trained on large corpora and then ﬁne-tuned for the task at hand: BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)\\nuses a denoising self-supervised pre-training task, while the GPT line of work uses language mod-\\neling as its pre-training task (Radford et al., 2018; 2019; Brown et al., 2020).\\nNaive application of self-attention to images would require that each pixel attends to every other\\npixel. With quadratic cost in the number of pixels, this does not scale to realistic input sizes. Thus,\\nto apply Transformers in the context of image processing, several approximations have been tried in\\nthe past. Parmar et al. (2018) applied the self-attention only in local neighborhoods for each query\\npixel instead of globally. Such local multi-head dot-product self attention blocks can completely\\nreplace convolutions (Hu et al., 2019; Ramachandran et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). In a different\\nline of work, Sparse Transformers (Child et al., 2019) employ scalable approximations to global self-\\nattention in order to be applicable to images. An alternative way to scale attention is to apply it in\\nblocks of varying sizes (Weissenborn et al., 2019), in the extreme case only along individual axes (Ho\\net al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020a). Many of these specialized attention architectures demonstrate\\npromising results on computer vision tasks, but require complex engineering to be implemented\\nefﬁciently on hardware accelerators.\\nMost related to ours is the model of Cordonnier et al. (2020), which extracts patches of size 2× 2\\nfrom the input image and applies full self-attention on top. This model is very similar to ViT,\\nbut our work goes further to demonstrate that large scale pre-training makes vanilla transformers\\ncompetitive with (or even better than) state-of-the-art CNNs. Moreover, Cordonnier et al. (2020)\\nuse a small patch size of 2× 2 pixels, which makes the model applicable only to small-resolution\\nimages, while we handle medium-resolution images as well.\\nThere has also been a lot of interest in combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with forms\\nof self-attention, e.g. by augmenting feature maps for image classiﬁcation (Bello et al., 2019) or by\\nfurther processing the output of a CNN using self-attention, e.g. for object detection (Hu et al., 2018;\\nCarion et al., 2020), video processing (Wang et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2019), image classiﬁcation (Wu\\net al., 2020), unsupervised object discovery (Locatello et al., 2020), or uniﬁed text-vision tasks (Chen\\net al., 2020c; Lu et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019).\\nAnother recent related model is image GPT (iGPT) (Chen et al., 2020a), which applies Transformers\\nto image pixels after reducing image resolution and color space. The model is trained in an unsu-\\npervised fashion as a generative model, and the resulting representation can then be ﬁne-tuned or\\nprobed linearly for classiﬁcation performance, achieving a maximal accuracy of 72% on ImageNet.\\nOur work adds to the increasing collection of papers that explore image recognition at larger scales\\nthan the standard ImageNet dataset. The use of additional data sources allows to achieve state-of-\\nthe-art results on standard benchmarks (Mahajan et al., 2018; Touvron et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2020).\\nMoreover, Sun et al. (2017) study how CNN performance scales with dataset size, and Kolesnikov\\net al. (2020); Djolonga et al. (2020) perform an empirical exploration of CNN transfer learning from\\nlarge scale datasets such as ImageNet-21k and JFT-300M. We focus on these two latter datasets as\\nwell, but train Transformers instead of ResNet-based models used in prior works.\\n2'),\n",

We split an image into ﬁxed-size patches, linearly embed each of them,\\nadd position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer\\nencoder. In order to perform classiﬁcation, we use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable\\n“classiﬁcation token” to the sequence. The illustration of the Transformer encoder was inspired by\\nVaswani et al. (2017).\\n3 M ETHOD\\nIn model design we follow the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) as closely as possible.\\nAn advantage of this intentionally simple setup is that scalable NLP Transformer architectures – and\\ntheir efﬁcient implementations – can be used almost out of the box.\\n3.1 V ISION TRANSFORMER (V IT)\\nAn overview of the model is depicted in Figure 1. The standard Transformer receives as input a 1D\\nsequence of token embeddings. To handle 2D images, we reshape the image x∈ RH×W×C into a\\nsequence of ﬂattened 2D patches xp∈ RN×(P 2·C), where (H,W ) is the resolution of the original\\nimage,C is the number of channels,(P,P ) is the resolution of each image patch, andN =HW/P 2\\nis the resulting number of patches, which also serves as the effective input sequence length for the\\nTransformer. The Transformer uses constant latent vector size D through all of its layers, so we\\nﬂatten the patches and map to D dimensions with a trainable linear projection (Eq. 1). We refer to\\nthe output of this projection as the patch embeddings.\\nSimilar to BERT’s [class] token, we prepend a learnable embedding to the sequence of embed-\\nded patches (z0\\n0 = xclass), whose state at the output of the Transformer encoder ( z0\\nL) serves as the\\nimage representation y (Eq. 4). Both during pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, a classiﬁcation head is at-\\ntached to z0\\nL. The classiﬁcation head is implemented by a MLP with one hidden layer at pre-training\\ntime and by a single linear layer at ﬁne-tuning time.\\nPosition embeddings are added to the patch embeddings to retain positional information. We use\\nstandard learnable 1D position embeddings, since we have not observed signiﬁcant performance\\ngains from using more advanced 2D-aware position embeddings (Appendix D.4). The resulting\\nsequence of embedding vectors serves as input to the encoder.\\nThe Transformer encoder (Vaswani et al., 2017) consists of alternating layers of multiheaded self-\\nattention (MSA, see Appendix A) and MLP blocks (Eq. 2, 3). Layernorm (LN) is applied before\\nevery block, and residual connections after every block (Wang et al., 2019; Baevski & Auli, 2019).\\n3'),\n",

As an alternative to raw image patches, the input sequence can be formed\\nfrom feature maps of a CNN (LeCun et al., 1989). In this hybrid model, the patch embedding\\nprojection E (Eq. 1) is applied to patches extracted from a CNN feature map. As a special case,\\nthe patches can have spatial size 1x1, which means that the input sequence is obtained by simply\\nﬂattening the spatial dimensions of the feature map and projecting to the Transformer dimension.\\nThe classiﬁcation input embedding and position embeddings are added as described above.\\n3.2 F INE -TUNING AND HIGHER RESOLUTION\\nTypically, we pre-train ViT on large datasets, and ﬁne-tune to (smaller) downstream tasks. For\\nthis, we remove the pre-trained prediction head and attach a zero-initialized D×K feedforward\\nlayer, where K is the number of downstream classes. It is often beneﬁcial to ﬁne-tune at higher\\nresolution than pre-training (Touvron et al., 2019; Kolesnikov et al., 2020). When feeding images\\nof higher resolution, we keep the patch size the same, which results in a larger effective sequence\\nlength. The Vision Transformer can handle arbitrary sequence lengths (up to memory constraints),\\nhowever, the pre-trained position embeddings may no longer be meaningful. We therefore perform\\n2D interpolation of the pre-trained position embeddings, according to their location in the original\\nimage. Note that this resolution adjustment and patch extraction are the only points at which an\\ninductive bias about the 2D structure of the images is manually injected into the Vision Transformer.\\n4 E XPERIMENTS\\nWe evaluate the representation learning capabilities of ResNet, Vision Transformer (ViT), and the\\nhybrid. To understand the data requirements of each model, we pre-train on datasets of varying size\\nand evaluate many benchmark tasks. When considering the computational cost of pre-training the\\nmodel, ViT performs very favourably, attaining state of the art on most recognition benchmarks at\\na lower pre-training cost. Lastly, we perform a small experiment using self-supervision, and show\\nthat self-supervised ViT holds promise for the future.\\n4.1 S ETUP\\nDatasets. To explore model scalability, we use the ILSVRC-2012 ImageNet dataset with 1k classes\\nand 1.3M images (we refer to it as ImageNet in what follows), its superset ImageNet-21k with\\n21k classes and 14M images (Deng et al., 2009), and JFT (Sun et al., 2017) with 18k classes and\\n303M high-resolution images. We de-duplicate the pre-training datasets w.r.t. the test sets of the\\ndownstream tasks following Kolesnikov et al. (2020). We transfer the models trained on these\\ndataset to several benchmark tasks: ImageNet on the original validation labels and the cleaned-up\\nReaL labels (Beyer et al., 2020), CIFAR-10/100 (Krizhevsky, 2009), Oxford-IIIT Pets (Parkhi et al.,\\n2012), and Oxford Flowers-102 (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2008). For these datasets, pre-processing\\nfollows Kolesnikov et al. (2020).\\n4'),\n",

VTAB evaluates\\nlow-data transfer to diverse tasks, using 1 000 training examples per task. The tasks are divided into\\nthree groups: Natural – tasks like the above, Pets, CIFAR, etc. Specialized – medical and satellite\\nimagery, and Structured – tasks that require geometric understanding like localization.\\nModel Variants. We base ViT conﬁgurations on those used for BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), as\\nsummarized in Table 1. The “Base” and “Large” models are directly adopted from BERT and we\\nadd the larger “Huge” model. In what follows we use brief notation to indicate the model size and\\nthe input patch size: for instance, ViT-L/16 means the “Large” variant with16× 16 input patch size.\\nNote that the Transformer’s sequence length is inversely proportional to the square of the patch size,\\nthus models with smaller patch size are computationally more expensive.\\nFor the baseline CNNs, we use ResNet (He et al., 2016), but replace the Batch Normalization lay-\\ners (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) with Group Normalization (Wu & He, 2018), and used standardized\\nconvolutions (Qiao et al., 2019). These modiﬁcations improve transfer (Kolesnikov et al., 2020),\\nand we denote the modiﬁed model “ResNet (BiT)”. For the hybrids, we feed the intermediate fea-\\nture maps into ViT with patch size of one “pixel”. To experiment with different sequence lengths,\\nwe either (i) take the output of stage 4 of a regular ResNet50 or (ii) remove stage 4, place the same\\nnumber of layers in stage 3 (keeping the total number of layers), and take the output of this extended\\nstage 3. Option (ii) results in a 4x longer sequence length, and a more expensive ViT model.\\nTraining & Fine-tuning. We train all models, including ResNets, using Adam (Kingma & Ba,\\n2015) withβ1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.999, a batch size of 4096 and apply a high weight decay of 0.1, which\\nwe found to be useful for transfer of all models (Appendix D.1 shows that, in contrast to common\\npractices, Adam works slightly better than SGD for ResNets in our setting). We use a linear learning\\nrate warmup and decay, see Appendix B.1 for details. For ﬁne-tuning we use SGD with momentum,\\nbatch size 512, for all models, see Appendix B.1.1. For ImageNet results in Table 2, we ﬁne-tuned at\\nhigher resolution: 512 for ViT-L/16 and 518 for ViT-H/14, and also used Polyak & Juditsky (1992)\\naveraging with a factor of 0.9999 (Ramachandran et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020b).\\nMetrics. We report results on downstream datasets either through few-shot or ﬁne-tuning accuracy.\\nFine-tuning accuracies capture the performance of each model after ﬁne-tuning it on the respective\\ndataset. Few-shot accuracies are obtained by solving a regularized least-squares regression problem\\nthat maps the (frozen) representation of a subset of training images to{−1, 1}K target vectors. This\\nformulation allows us to recover the exact solution in closed form. Though we mainly focus on\\nﬁne-tuning performance, we sometimes use linear few-shot accuracies for fast on-the-ﬂy evaluation\\nwhere ﬁne-tuning would be too costly.\\n4.2 C OMPARISON TO STATE OF THE ART\\nWe ﬁrst compare our largest models – ViT-H/14 and ViT-L/16 – to state-of-the-art CNNs from\\nthe literature. The ﬁrst comparison point is Big Transfer (BiT) (Kolesnikov et al., 2020), which\\nperforms supervised transfer learning with large ResNets. The second is Noisy Student (Xie et al.,\\n2020), which is a large EfﬁcientNet trained using semi-supervised learning on ImageNet and JFT-\\n300M with the labels removed. Currently, Noisy Student is the state of the art on ImageNet and\\nBiT-L on the other datasets reported here. All models were trained on TPUv3 hardware, and we\\nreport the number of TPUv3-core-days taken to pre-train each of them, that is, the number of TPU\\nv3 cores (2 per chip) used for training multiplied by the training time in days.\\nTable 2 shows the results. The smaller ViT-L/16 model pre-trained on JFT-300M outperforms BiT-L\\n(which is pre-trained on the same dataset) on all tasks, while requiring substantially less computa-\\ntional resources to train. The larger model, ViT-H/14, further improves the performance, especially\\non the more challenging datasets – ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and the VTAB suite. Interestingly, this\\n5'),\n",

Detailed results per model are provided in Table 6 in the Ap-\\npendix. A few patterns can be observed. First, Vision Transformers dominate ResNets on the\\nperformance/compute trade-off. ViT uses approximately 2− 4× less compute to attain the same\\nperformance (average over 5 datasets). Second, hybrids slightly outperform ViT at small compu-\\ntational budgets, but the difference vanishes for larger models. This result is somewhat surprising,\\nsince one might expect convolutional local feature processing to assist ViT at any size. Third, Vision\\nTransformers appear not to saturate within the range tried, motivating future scaling efforts.\\n4.5 I NSPECTING VISION TRANSFORMER\\nInput\\n Attention\\nFigure 6: Representative ex-\\namples of attention from the\\noutput token to the input\\nspace. See Appendix D.7 for\\ndetails.\\nTo begin to understand how the Vision Transformer processes im-\\nage data, we analyze its internal representations. The ﬁrst layer of\\nthe Vision Transformer linearly projects the ﬂattened patches into a\\nlower-dimensional space (Eq. 1). Figure 7 (left) shows the top prin-\\ncipal components of the the learned embedding ﬁlters. The com-\\nponents resemble plausible basis functions for a low-dimensional\\nrepresentation of the ﬁne structure within each patch.\\nAfter the projection, a learned position embedding is added to the\\npatch representations. Figure 7 (center) shows that the model learns\\nto encode distance within the image in the similarity of position em-\\nbeddings, i.e. closer patches tend to have more similar position em-\\nbeddings. Further, the row-column structure appears; patches in the\\nsame row/column have similar embeddings. Finally, a sinusoidal\\nstructure is sometimes apparent for larger grids (Appendix D). That\\nthe position embeddings learn to represent 2D image topology ex-\\nplains why hand-crafted 2D-aware embedding variants do not yield\\nimprovements (Appendix D.4).\\nSelf-attention allows ViT to integrate information across the entire\\nimage even in the lowest layers. We investigate to what degree\\nthe network makes use of this capability. Speciﬁcally, we compute\\nthe average distance in image space across which information is\\nintegrated, based on the attention weights (Figure 7, right). This\\n“attention distance” is analogous to receptive ﬁeld size in CNNs.\\nWe ﬁnd that some heads attend to most of the image already in the lowest layers, showing that\\nthe ability to integrate information globally is indeed used by the model. Other attention heads\\nhave consistently small attention distances in the low layers. This highly localized attention is\\nless pronounced in hybrid models that apply a ResNet before the Transformer (Figure 7, right),\\nsuggesting that it may serve a similar function as early convolutional layers in CNNs. Further, the\\nattention distance increases with network depth. Globally, we ﬁnd that the model attends to image\\nregions that are semantically relevant for classiﬁcation (Figure 6).\\n4.6 S ELF -SUPERVISION\\nTransformers show impressive performance on NLP tasks.

We leave exploration of contrastive pre-training (Chen\\net al., 2020b; He et al., 2020; Bachman et al., 2019; H´enaff et al., 2020) to future work.\\n5 C ONCLUSION\\nWe have explored the direct application of Transformers to image recognition. Unlike prior works\\nusing self-attention in computer vision, we do not introduce image-speciﬁc inductive biases into\\nthe architecture apart from the initial patch extraction step. Instead, we interpret an image as a\\nsequence of patches and process it by a standard Transformer encoder as used in NLP. This simple,\\nyet scalable, strategy works surprisingly well when coupled with pre-training on large datasets.\\nThus, Vision Transformer matches or exceeds the state of the art on many image classiﬁcation\\ndatasets, whilst being relatively cheap to pre-train.\\nWhile these initial results are encouraging, many challenges remain. One is to apply ViT to other\\ncomputer vision tasks, such as detection and segmentation. Our results, coupled with those in Carion\\net al. (2020), indicate the promise of this approach. Another challenge is to continue exploring self-\\nsupervised pre-training methods. Our initial experiments show improvement from self-supervised\\npre-training, but there is still large gap between self-supervised and large-scale supervised pre-\\ntraining. Finally, further scaling of ViT would likely lead to improved performance.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nThe work was performed in Berlin, Z ¨urich, and Amsterdam.

For each element in an input sequence z∈ RN×D, we compute a weighted sum over all\\nvalues v in the sequence.

Finally, all\\ntraining is done on resolution 224.\\nB.1.1 F INE -TUNING\\nWe ﬁne-tune all ViT models using SGD with a momentum of 0.9. We run a small grid search over\\nlearning rates, see learning rate ranges in Table 4. To do so, we use small sub-splits from the training\\nset (10% for Pets and Flowers, 2% for CIFAR, 1% ImageNet) as development set and train on the\\nremaining data. For ﬁnal results we train on the entire training set and evaluate on the respective\\ntest data. For ﬁne-tuning ResNets and hybrid models we use the exact same setup, with the only\\nexception of ImageNet where we add another value 0.06 to the learning rate sweep. Additionally,\\n13'),\n",

If not mentioned otherwise,\\nﬁne-tuning resolution is 384.\\nfor ResNets we also run the setup of Kolesnikov et al. (2020) and select the best results across\\nthis run and our sweep. Finally, if not mentioned otherwise, all ﬁne-tuning experiments run at 384\\nresolution (running ﬁne-tuning at different resolution than training is common practice (Kolesnikov\\net al., 2020)).\\nWhen transferring ViT models to another dataset, we remove the whole head (two linear layers) and\\nreplace it by a single, zero-initialized linear layer outputting the number of classes required by the\\ntarget dataset. We found this to be a little more robust than simply re-initializing the very last layer.\\nFor VTAB we follow the protocol in Kolesnikov et al. (2020), and use the same hyperparameter\\nsetting for all tasks. We use a learning rate of 0.01 and train for 2500 steps (Tab. 4). We chose this\\nsetting by running a small sweep over two learning rates and two schedules, and selecting the setting\\nwith the highest VTAB score on the 200-example validation sets. We follow the pre-processing used\\nin Kolesnikov et al. (2020), except that we do not use task-speciﬁc input resolutions. Instead we ﬁnd\\nthat Vision Transformer beneﬁts most from a high resolution (384× 384) for all tasks.\\nB.1.2 S ELF -SUPERVISION\\nWe employ the masked patch prediction objective for preliminary self-supervision experiments. To\\ndo so we corrupt 50% of patch embeddings by either replacing their embeddings with a learnable\\n[mask] embedding (80%), a random other patch embedding (10%) or just keeping them as is\\n(10%). This setup is very similar to the one used for language by Devlin et al. (2019). Finally, we\\npredict the 3-bit, mean color (i.e., 512 colors in total) of every corrupted patch using their respective\\npatch representations.\\nWe trained our self-supervised model for 1M steps (ca. 14 epochs) with batch size 4096 on JFT. We\\nuse Adam, with a base learning rate of2· 10−4, warmup of 10k steps and cosine learning rate decay.\\nAs prediction targets for pretraining we tried the following settings: 1) predicting only the mean,\\n3bit color (i.e., 1 prediction of 512 colors), 2) predicting a 4× 4 downsized version of the 16× 16\\npatch with 3bit colors in parallel (i.e., 16 predictions of 512 colors), 3) regression on the full patch\\nusing L2 (i.e., 256 regressions on the 3 RGB channels). Surprisingly, we found that all worked quite\\nwell, though L2 was slightly worse. We report ﬁnal results only for option 1) because it has shown\\nbest few-shot performance. We also experimented with 15% corruption rate as used by Devlin et al.\\n(2019) but results were also slightly worse on our few-shot metrics.\\nLastly, we would like to remark that our instantiation of masked patch prediction doesn’t require\\nsuch an enormous amount of pretraining nor a large dataset such as JFT in order to lead to sim-\\nilar performance gains on ImageNet classiﬁcation. That is, we observed diminishing returns on\\ndownstream performance after 100k pretraining steps, and see similar gains when pretraining on\\nImageNet.\\nC A DDITIONAL RESULTS\\nWe report detailed results corresponding to the ﬁgures presented in the paper.

All conﬁgurations are based on a ViT model with8 layers,D = 1024,\\nDM LP = 2048 and a patch size of 32, the intersection of all lines. We can see that scaling the\\ndepth results in the biggest improvements which are clearly visible up until 64 layers. However,\\ndiminishing returns are already visible after 16 layers. Interestingly, scaling the width of the net-\\nwork seems to result in the smallest changes. Decreasing the patch size and thus increasing the\\neffective sequence length shows surprisingly robust improvements without introducing parameters.\\nThese ﬁndings suggest that compute might be a better predictor of performance than the number of\\nparameters, and that scaling should emphasize depth over width if any. Overall, we ﬁnd that scaling\\nall dimensions proportionally results in robust improvements.\\nD.3 H EAD TYPE AND C L A S S TOKEN\\nIn order to stay as close as possible to the original Transformer model, we made use of an additional\\n[class] token, which is taken as image representation.

An initial attempt at using only image-patch embeddings, globally average-pooling (GAP)\\nthem, followed by a linear classiﬁer—just like ResNet’s ﬁnal feature map—performed very poorly.\\nHowever, we found that this is neither due to the extra token, nor to the GAP operation.

We\\ntried the following cases:\\n• Providing no positional information: Considering the inputs as a bag of patches.\\n• 1-dimensional positional embedding: Considering the inputs as a sequence of patches in\\nthe raster order (default across all other experiments in this paper).\\n• 2-dimensional positional embedding: Considering the inputs as a grid of patches in two\\ndimensions. In this case, two sets of embeddings are learned, each for one of the axes,\\nX-embedding, and Y -embedding, each with size D/2. Then, based on the coordinate on\\nthe path in the input, we concatenate the X and Y embedding to get the ﬁnal positional\\nembedding for that patch.\\n• Relative positional embeddings: Considering the relative distance between patches to en-\\ncode the spatial information as instead of their absolute position. To do so, we use 1-\\ndimensional Relative Attention, in which we deﬁne the relative distance all possible pairs\\nof patches. Thus, for every given pair (one as query, and the other as key/value in the at-\\ntention mechanism), we have an offset pq−pk, where each offset is associated with an\\nembedding. Then, we simply run extra attention, where we use the original query (the\\ncontent of query), but use relative positional embeddings as keys. We then use the log-\\nits from the relative attention as a bias term and add it to the logits of the main attention\\n(content-based attention) before applying the softmax.\\nIn addition to different ways of encoding spatial information, we also tried different ways of in-\\ncorporating this information in our model. For the 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional positional\\nembeddings, we tried three different cases: (1) add positional embeddings to the inputs right after\\n17'),\n",

As we can see, while\\nthere is a large gap between the performances of the model with no positional embedding and mod-\\nels with positional embedding, there is little to no difference between different ways of encoding\\npositional information. We speculate that since our Transformer encoder operates on patch-level\\ninputs, as opposed to pixel-level, the differences in how to encode spatial information is less impor-\\ntant. More precisely, in patch-level inputs, the spatial dimensions are much smaller than the original\\npixel-level inputs, e.g., 14× 14 as opposed to 224× 224, and learning to represent the spatial re-\\nlations in this resolution is equally easy for these different positional encoding strategies.

The general idea of axial\\nattention is to perform multiple attention operations, each along a single axis of the input tensor,\\ninstead of applying 1-dimensional attention to the ﬂattened version of the input. In axial attention,\\neach attention mixes information along a particular axis, while keeping information along the other\\naxes independent. Along this line, Wang et al. (2020b) proposed the AxialResNet model in which\\nall the convolutions with kernel size 3× 3 in a ResNet50 are replaced by axial self-attention, i.e.\\na row and column attention, augmented by relative positional encoding. We have implemented\\nAxialResNet as a baseline model.3.\\nMoreover, we have modiﬁed ViT to process inputs in the 2-dimensional shape, instead of a 1-\\ndimensional sequence of patches, and incorporate Axial Transformer blocks, in which instead of\\na self-attention followed by an MLP, we have a a row-self-attention plus an MLP followed by a\\ncolumn-self-attention plus an MLP.\\nFigure 13, present the performance of Axial ResNet, Axial-ViT-B/32 and Axial-ViT-B/16 on Ima-\\ngeNet 5shot linear, when pretrained on JFT dataset, verses the pretraining compute, both in terms of\\nnumber of FLOPs and inference time (example per seconds). As we can see, both Axial-ViT-B/32\\nand Axial-ViT-B/16 do better than their ViT-B counterpart in terms of performance, but it comes at\\n3Our implementation is based on the open-sourced PyTorch implementation inhttps://github.com/\\ncsrhddlam/axial-deeplab. In our experiments, we reproduced the scores reported in (Wang et al.,\\n2020b) in terms of accuracy, however, our implementation, similar to the open-source implementation, is very\\nslow on TPUs. Therefore, we were not able to use it for extensive large-scale experiments. These may be\\nunlocked by a carefully optimized implementation.\\n19'),\n",

For the AxialResNet, although it looks reasonable in\\nterms of accuracy/compute trade-off (Figure 13, left), the naive implementation is extremely slow\\non TPUs (Figure 13, right).\\nD.7 A TTENTION DISTANCE\\nTo understand how ViT uses self-attention to integrate information across the image, we analyzed\\nthe average distance spanned by attention weights at different layers (Figure 11). This “attention\\ndistance” is analogous to receptive ﬁeld size in CNNs. Average attention distance is highly variable\\nacross heads in lower layers, with some heads attending to much of the image, while others attend\\nto small regions at or near the query location. As depth increases, attention distance increases for all\\nheads. In the second half of the network, most heads attend widely across tokens.\\nD.8 A TTENTION MAPS\\nTo compute maps of the attention from the output token to the input space (Figures 6 and 14), we\\nused Attention Rollout (Abnar & Zuidema, 2020). Brieﬂy, we averaged attention weights of ViT-\\nL/16 across all heads and then recursively multiplied the weight matrices of all layers.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = ( z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK T\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0 , xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndf f = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions.

Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10 −9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0 .6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.
